Kawaii outside
I’m a warrior inside
I was born the way i am
Not straight not gay
Biting words pure heart
That is always how i start
I absorb every day
My power my pain
Kawaii outside
I’m a warrior inside
I was born the way i am
Not straight not gay
Biting words pure heart
That is always how i start
I absorb every day
My power my pain
I really am, not seem
I have a dark hole in my heart
It’s taking everything away
«She’s never enough
She’s never enough» — they say
I have a dark hole in my heart
It’s taking everything away
«She’s never enough
She’s never enough» — they say
I’m a warrior inside
I’m a warrior inside
Human human human human
