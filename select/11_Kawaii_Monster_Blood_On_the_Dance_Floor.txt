I'm the beauty to the beast
I slip inside the sheets
Tear it up, rip it up, I'ma monster (ha ha)
First I'm sour then I'm sweet
Never trick, I only treat
How cool do I gotta be before your heart will miss a beat?
To the day and to the night
Monsters shine in the moonlight
So shallow, six feet deep
You're the cutest when you sleep
Squeeze you tight, leave you speechless
Nighty-night, rest in pieces
Say you love me for my brain?
Funny, I can say the same...

Talk nerdy to me
I am a weapon of mass consumption
Got it locked on tight for destruction

Mochi, mochi, see you more like Yoshi
Double face smiley, that's my emoji
I am so high I can eat desert
Can't bring me down, living large like a monster

I wanna make you scream
I wanna play in your blood
Let me kiss you sweet
So I can rip out your tongue
I wanna hold you tight
I wanna steal your breath
Not gonna let you go, not gonna let you go
I wanna make you scream
I wanna play in your blood
Let me kiss you sweet
So I can rip out your tongue
I wanna hold you tight
I wanna steal your breath
Not gonna let you go, not gonna let you go

Keep it deadly, bitches love me
Not sure if you'll hurt or hug me
Kiss and kill me, run away
Fight me like a [?]
Fear me, love me all the same
Quiet little monster far from tame
All the guts, glitter and fame
Keep it deadly, bitches love me
Not sure if you'll hurt or hug me
Kiss and kill me, run away
Fight me like a [?]
Fear me, love me all the same
Quiet little monster far from tame
All the guts, glitter and fame

Serial killer love to spoon
Cold black stare will make you swoon
Get you hard like I'm Medusa
Razor sharp, whoa you used to
Now I'm dripping, full of slime
Your nightmare is my good time
Play with me like Bride of Chucky
If you wake up, you are lucky
A doll likes to have some fun
Kiss you, kill you, then I'm done
Let's party like it's Halloween
The living dead for murder queen
Sexy set like Dracula
Smile when I'm attacking ya
Bring you flowers, if you behave
I will place them on your grave...

Talk nerdy to me
I am a weapon of mass consumption
Got it locked on tight for destruction

All is fair in war and peace
I feel alive when you're deceased
So fucked up, my friends are dead
Yell it loud, "Off with his head!"
Trace your forms with fingertips
Stick my claws into your hips
Keep my blood thirst under cover
With this pillow I will smother

I wanna make you scream
I wanna play in your blood
Let me kiss you sweet
So I can rip out your tongue
I wanna hold you tight
I wanna steal your breath
Not gonna let you go, not gonna let you go
I wanna make you scream
I wanna play in your blood
Let me kiss you sweet
So I can rip out your tongue
I wanna hold you tight
I wanna steal your breath
Not gonna let you go, not gonna let you go

Keep it deadly, bitches love me
Not sure if you'll hurt or hug me
Kiss and kill me, run away
Fight me like a [?]
Fear me, love me all the same
Quiet little monster far from tame
All the guts, glitter and fame
Keep it deadly, bitches love me
Not sure if you'll hurt or hug me
Kiss and kill me, run away
Fight me like a [?]
Fear me, love me all the same
Quiet little monster far from tame
All the guts, glitter and fame
